## about

Hello, welcome to the homepage of yifei feng 😼

I am an undergraduate student majoring in computer science from the School of Artificial Intelligence of Beijing Normal University. I will go to North America in 2025 (or 2026) to study for a master's degree in computer science, and then I plan to study for a PhD and further my studies in the field of systems. In particular, I am interested in HPC, MLsys, PL, software analysis, software and hardware co-design, and security fields 🧐

- With the development of AI over the years, the demand for computing power is increasing day by day. If we can master the knowledge of AI and System fields at the same time and combine them, thus we can become the one who build system with large impact
- HW & SW co-design is conducive to maximizing the use of computing power and developing a benign ecosystem. The success of nvdia and apple proves this.
- I studied UCB's cs61a when I was introductory to programming. The simplicity and elegance of the scheme interpreter in the final project of the course shocked me deeply. I want to develop some knowledge about PL and software analysis to help me understand programming about programming.
- Protecting citizens’ privacy is very important in this Internet era

In the process of learning computers, I have been deeply helped by the Internet and the open source spirit. I am very grateful to all of you who I met during the journey.
